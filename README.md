# Stargram

I created this project as a clone of Instagram(another?), this one is specialized in astrophotography, so it will provide you specific attributes to set on your photos, such as: Photographed object, Telescope, Mountage, Tripod, Edition Software, Exposure Time, Gain, ISO, etc...

This project is divided in two parts, this one is the front-end, I decided to develop it using Angular as SPA framework, and Angular Material as design components library.
